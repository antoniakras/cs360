#  Emergency Room (ER) Management System
---
## 🚀 About  

This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a **Java web application using Servlets, JDBC, and SQL** . It follows a **REST-style architecture**, exposing endpoints for data management and interaction with a relational database, deployed on an **Apache Tomcat container**.

Emergency Room (ER) Management System built with **SQL and E-R schema modeling**, designed to track patients, doctors, visits, examinations, prescriptions, and personal medical history. The system provides a **comprehensive backend** for hospital operations, including patient re-examinations, medication tracking, test results, and special conditions (e.g., COVID-19).  

This project highlights skills in **backend development, normalized schema design, complex SQL queries, and real-world hospital workflow modeling**.

## 📂 Features & Highlights

- **Java Servlets Backend** – Handles requests and implements business logic via REST-style API endpoints.
- **Relational Database Integration** – Uses JDBC with a normalized SQL schema to manage patients, doctors, visits, examinations, prescriptions, and medical history.
- **E-R Diagram Design** – Models hospital ER workflow with entities, relationships, keys, and constraints.
- **Complex SQL Queries & Analytics** – Multi-table JOINs, nested subqueries, GROUP BY + HAVING for advanced reporting (top doctors, frequent patients, COVID-19 cases), and referential integrity checks.
- **Patient History Management** – Fetches past visits, tests, and prescribed medications, including re-examinations.
- **Deployment** – Fully configured for Apache Tomcat; ready to run and test backend functionality.

## 🛠️ Setup & Run

1. Import the SQL schema in your preferred relational database (MySQL/PostgreSQL).  
2. Populate sample data using provided SQL scripts in the `/db` folder.  
3. Connect Java backend or query via SQL client to run queries and test functionality.
